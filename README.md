## Description
{This is a detailed description of your application, including its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have.
Upon installing the app, you will be prompted to login and create a profile. This entails bank details that will enable you to both lend and receive borrowed money from our users.
Lender - can lend from as low as 1000ksh, and this goes to his public ledger that is visible only to himself but displayed as anonymous to the borrower

for a lender to loan our user, they look at past transactions of the borrower, which are displayed alongside to the loan contract. The loan contract has the time period for the loan, interest it will accrue and much more on penalties and reimbursement steps in case of default in payment

Borrower - Upon signing up and choosing the borrow option, you will be prompted with a friendly step by step process that will inquire the amount, the interest you would like to pay, the time period for the loan, and you will be able to submit only if your credit score is 1200 and above. Your request is sent to our potential lenders willing to lend the amounts in your range. The available lenders will all receive your request and review your publicly available anonymous ledger which has a summary of your past transactions and rate of paying back. The profile will remain Anonymous both in terms of gender, race, and location...only the financial information will be available to the lender.

Complete transaction happens when a potential lender accepts your request, this makes the request unavailable to other lenders...If a lender decides to cancel the request again, they are charged a fee, so every lender who to accepts to lend  should be able to finish the transaction.

default in payment - If the borrower does not live up to the set date pay back the debt owed, their rating is automatically reduced by a certain number of points, if lets say it was 1200, they could go to 1160. The record is of default in payment goes to the borrowers public ledger permanently as the public ledgers are immutable. This affects both the credit score of the individual and his trust with future potential lenders.

In case of default, the lender receives their initial lent out amount. LeBoA's law and default policy will take effect and the individual will be contacted with possible penalty upon failure to clear up the loan in the additional grace period provided. Read more on the default policies and penalties in our terms and conditions page.
